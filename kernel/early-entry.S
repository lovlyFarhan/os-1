    ARM stacks grow down, so set the initial stack pointer to the "high"
    end of the chunk of memory designated for our initialization stack.

    There are some gymnastics here, because the C data structure providing
    the storage of the stack is linked expecting to be accessed from
    "high memory" kernel addresses (>= 0xc0000000).

    So we have to apply corrections both to the address of the pointer
    variable (uint8_t * init_stack_ceiling) that records the address of
    the top end of the stack, and of the payload of that memory too.

    r0: VMA of main kernel
    r1: low-memory evaluation of &init_stack_ceiling
    sp: low-memory evaluation of *(&init_stack_ceiling)

    Note that this call must not return. Setting up regular protected
    mode will result in the VM unmapping this early init code, so there
    would be no valid instruction at the next address anyway.

    We use a BX instruction here because the branch is 3GB--far beyond
    the maximum allowed PC-relative target for label encoded directly
