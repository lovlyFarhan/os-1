 * \brief   Task control block implementation, and core scheduler

 *
 * Threads in the operating system can either be pure kernel-space
 * entities or can be the stream of control for a classical protected-
 * memory Process. If belonging to a process, then the kernel-space
 * stack is used to host the supervisor-mode backend of system calls.
 *
 * Each thread's instance of this structure is housed inside the top of
 * the VM page used for the thread's kernel stack. This avoids object allocations
 * and also makes deducing the current thread easy: just compute the right
 * offset in the page containing the current stack pointer.
 *
 * To perform a scheduling operation (anything that manipulates the
 * runlists or calls RunNextThread), a systemwide scheduler-protecting
 * lock must be acquired. For example:
 *
 * \code
 * void WaitForProcessTerminated (Process * p) {
 *
 *   Process::WaitRecord r;
 *   r.waiter = THREAD_CURRENT();
 *
 *   // Add myself into p's wait list
 *   p->addTerminationWaiter(&r);
 *
 *   Thread::BeginTransaction();
 *   while (!p->terminated) {
 *     // Remove myself from the runlist
 *     Thread::MakeUnready(THREAD_CURRENT(), Thread::STATE_SOMETHING_OR_OTHER);
 *
 *     // Choose and switch into next task. Because I took myself out of the
 *     // run queue above, this will cause me to sleep until some other thread
 *     // performing the code that terminates p removes me from the
 *     // wait-list above and calls Thread::MakeReady() on me.
 *     Thread::RunNextThread();
 *
 *     // For control to reach here, somebody has removed us from p's wait-list
 *     // and made us runnable again.
 *   }
 *   Thread::EndTransaction();
 * }
